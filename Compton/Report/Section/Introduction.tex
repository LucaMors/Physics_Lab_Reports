\section*{Introduction}

Compton scattering represents the main  type of $\gamma$-matter interaction with $\gamma$ energy of the MeV order.   
The aim of this experiment is to present the study of Compton Scattering performed with the experimental Set Up described in the following section.
This report will analyze these steps:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Energy calibration of the three inorganic scintillators.
	\item Verification of the relationship between energy and angle of the diffused photon.
	\item Measure of the differential cross section of Compton Scattering.
\end{itemize}
