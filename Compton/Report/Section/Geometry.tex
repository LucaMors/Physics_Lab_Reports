\section*{Scattered Photon Energy}
To study the angular dependence of the scattered $\gamma$ a coincidence between the three detectors was selected as trigger of the system. The coincidence between Tagger and Scatterer ensures the detection of the  two collinear 511~keV $\gamma$, then the triple coincidence with the Detector allows to select the Compton scattered $\gamma$ at the chosen angle. The data collection was performed over six different angles from 0$^\circ$ to 90$^\circ$, the last one~(90$^\circ$) through a night run because of the lower rate~(see Tab.~\ref{Tab:Rates}).

		   0$^\circ$ & 7.3 \\

\end{table}

The energy of recoil electrons and scattered $\gamma$ measured by the Scatterer and Detector respectively as a function of scattering angle, is presented in Fig.~\ref{Fig:Scattering_angles}:

\end{figure}

\newpage
The measured energy values are obtained by a Gaussian fit of the peaks in the acquired spectra of the detectors, and compared to the expected theoretical values predicted by the compton scattering equation:
\begin{equation*}
	h\nu_f=\frac{h\nu_i}{1+\frac{h\nu_i}{m_e c^2}\left(1-\cos(\theta)\right)}
\end{equation*}

These measured values are reported in Tab.~\ref{Tab:Scattering_energy} together with the triple coincidence counts for each data acquisition.

It is shown also the counts of the triple coincidences which fall in the full energy peak of the Tagger and have a recoil electron energy less than 470~keV~(value selected considering the detector resolution).}

Using the 90$^\circ$ spectra~(data set with the highest statistic due to the longer acquisition time) the 2D density plot of Fig.~\ref{Fig:Correlation_Plot} was produced.  A linear fit over the data was performed in order to verify the energy conservation in the Compton scattering process.
