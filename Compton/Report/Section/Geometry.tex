\section*{Scattered photon energy}
To study the angular dependence of the scattered $\gamma$ a coincidence between the three detectors was selected as trigger of the system. The coincidence between Tagger and Scatterer ensures the detection of the  two collinear 511~keV $\gamma$ from the $^{22}$Na source, then the triple coincidence with the Detector allows to select the Compton scattered $\gamma$ at chosen angle. The data collection was performed over six different angles from 0$^\circ$ to 90$^\circ$, the last one~(90$^\circ$) through a night run because of the lower rate~(see Tab.~\ref{Tab:Rates}).

		 Angle & Rate[Hz] \\

		   0$^\circ$ & 7.3 \\

The energy of recoil electrons and scattered $\gamma$ measured by the Scatterer and Detector respectively as a function of scattering angle, is presented in Fig.~\ref{Fig:Scattering_angles}:

\end{figure}

\newpage
The measured energy values are obtained by a Gaussian fit of the peaks in the acquired spectra of the detectors, and compared to the expected theoretical values predicted by the compton scattering equation:
\begin{equation*}
	h\nu_f=\frac{h\nu_i}{1+\frac{h\nu_i}{m_e c^2}\left(1-cos(\theta)\right)}
\end{equation*}

These measured values are reported in Tab.~\ref{Tab:Scattering_energy} together with the triple coincidences counts for each data acquisition.

		  0$^\circ$ & 1942 &   8$\pm$19 &  497$\pm$15\\
		20$^\circ$ & 2163 &   19$\pm$48 &  480$\pm$28\\
		40$^\circ$ & 2402 &   86$\pm$36 &  423$\pm$37\\

It is shown also the counts of the triple coincidences which fall in the full energy peak of the Tagger and have a recoil electron energy less than 470~keV~(value selected considering the detector resolution).}

Using the 90$^\circ$ spectra~(data set with the highest statistic due to the longer acquisition time) the 2D density plot of Fig.~\ref{Fig:Correlation_Plot} was produced.  A linear fit over the data was performed in order to verify the energy conservation in the Compton scattering process.
