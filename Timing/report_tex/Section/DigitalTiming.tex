\section*{Digital Timing}

We can perform a digital timing that reconstructs all the analog chain using software. In order to do so we need the signal waveforms provided by the DT5751 CAEN digitizer\footnote{with a sampling rate of 1 GS/s}.
The digitized waveform then is manipulated in order to obtain a bipolar signal (Fig.\ref{Fig: digital waveform manipulations}).

\end{figure}
Then troughtout an algorithms we have to find the zero of the signal that is the time that we associate to the event.

\noindent The bipolar signal shape depends on two parameter that we need to tune in order to optimize the time resolution:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fraction
\item Delay
\end{itemize}
