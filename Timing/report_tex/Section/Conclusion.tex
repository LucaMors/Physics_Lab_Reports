\section*{Conclusion}
The aim of this report was to describe the timing analysis performed over two scintillation detectors. Therefore the calibration and the electronic setup have been described. The timing analysis was produced using both analog and digital techniques, using $^{22}$Na and $^{60}$Co as $\gamma$-sources. 
The analog timing was produced using a Quad CFTD mod. 935 and an Ortec TAC unit, and it allows to reach a FWHM of $0.55\pm0.01$~ns in the range 700-800~keV. The digital timing was produced instead using a CFD algorithm over the digitized signals of the detectors. The FWHM reached is $0.539\pm0.001$~ns in the range 200-250~keV. 

Finally moving the source between the detectors was possible to compute an evaluation of the speed of light. The obtained value is 29.08$\pm$0.06~cm/ns.
