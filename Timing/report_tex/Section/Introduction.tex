\section*{Goals of the experiment}
In this experiment we want to achieve the following goals:

\begin{itemize}
\item Energy calibration of the organic scintillators and
calculation of the energy resolution from the analysis of
the Compton edge.
\item Optimization of the external delay of the analogue
CFTD to obtain the best time resolution.
\item Study the time resolution behaviour as a function of the
energy.
\item Comparison between the timing resolutions obtained
from analogue and digital treatment of the signals.
\item Measurement of the speed of light. 
\end{itemize}
