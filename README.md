## Timing Experiment

In this experiment we want to achieve the following goals:

* Energy calibration of the organic scintillators and
calculation of the energy resolution from the analysis of
the Compton edge.
* Optimization of the external delay of the analogue
CFTD to obtain the best time resolution.
* Study the time resolution behaviour as a function of the
energy.
* Comparison between the timing resolutions obtained
from analogue and digital treatment of the signals.
* Measurement of the speed of light. 

## Compton Scattering Experiment

Key points of the experiments:

* Verifying the Compton Scattering formula
* Measuring the Compton Cross-Section at 90 degrees.

## Positronium Experiment

Studying the Positronium decay.

Positronium can be formed in two different states o-Ps with a mean lifetime of 142 ns and p-Ps with a mean lifetime of 152 ps.

o-Ps decay in 3 gammas and p-Ps in 2 gammas.

The key points of this experiment are:

* Measuring the Branching Ratio of the Ps decay channels
* Measuring the decay time distributions of o-Ps and p-Ps
