## Timing Experiment

In this experiment we want to achieve the following goals:

* Energy calibration of the organic scintillators and
calculation of the energy resolution from the analysis of
the Compton edge.
* Optimization of the external delay of the analogue
CFTD to obtain the best time resolution.
* Study the time resolution behaviour as a function of the
energy.
* Comparison between the timing resolutions obtained
from analogue and digital treatment of the signals.
* Measurement of the speed of light.
