\section*{Conclusion}
The aim of this report was to study the Positronium bound state, in particular the singlet p-Ps and triplet o-Ps. This was accomplished using four inorganic NaI(Tl) scintillators with a $^{22}$Na $\gamma$-source.

The experiment was focused on the computation of the branching ratio between the p-Ps and o-Ps decay channels, finding a value of  $(2.5\pm0.1)\times 10^{-3}$,  compatible with the reference one (1/372).  

The last part, instead, was dedicated to the study of timing distribution of the two decays. In the case of  o-Ps an estimate of the lifetime was computed, finding a value not compatible with the expected one due mainly to the poor statistics of the data collected. For p-Ps decay this was not possible due to the time resolution of the apparatus.
